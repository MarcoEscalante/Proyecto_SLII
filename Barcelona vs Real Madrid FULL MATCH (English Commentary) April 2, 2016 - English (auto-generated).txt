nightline Kevin Egan is there at the

captain all brought to you by AT&T

thank you very much Phil remember to use

the hashtag el clásico throughout the

match this segment is presented by AT&T

mobilizing your world and let me just

say but that was one of the most

emotional things I've ever seen inside a

sporting stadium every single person

inside camp now on their feet holding

the banner we see the huge sign saying

gracias Johan we saw the Catalan flag

the Barcelona flag and the Barcelona

Jersey with number 14 what a beautiful

tribute to the great johan cruyff as you

see the starting lineups only caution

away for Luis Suarez but that was at

risk in their last league game was able

to keep his nose clean and available

here today similar story for casa me

know in the real madrid starting lineup

was the starting lineups brought to you

by soccer calm

take a look at the table right now and

it is Barcelona 76 points Atletico

winning pocket at 70 Real Madrid at 66

now again on paper it seems even with

the defeat here today Barcelona should

be able to coast home but stranger

things have happened they can pretty

much slam shut

any possibility for an atlético Real

Madrid come back here today but they

have to get it done first and for Real

Madrid as we head into this moment of

silence perhaps a launching pad for the

glory to come the most silent film on

Cruyff both as a playing legend at a

coaching one for Barcelona

[Applause]

[Music]

[Applause]

[Applause]

[Music]

[Applause]

[Music]

now the sphere says he shook his head

and some of them disruptors and it's

surprising from

[Applause]

section of the fans it seemed to being

directly from Real Madrid fans but it

doesn't matter

or drowned out by the field assessing

wonderful tribute and now let's get

ready to rock and roll these two

footballing teams exemplify in the

spirit of the football that grace

displayed in different ways perhaps but

world-class footballers again we are

under away Barcelona in their familiar

Blaugrana and the all-white of Real

Madrid defending the goal towards the

right fill Shane alongside ray Hudson

and glad you could join us it is El

Clasico there is history to be made or

added to 170 second league match between

these two and Ray 200 in 31st 92 wins

for Real Madrid 90 for Barcelona it is

hard to separate these two in a rivalry

that dates back to the turn of the last

century allied on the far side Neymar

checking back Oh

for the present felt wonderful look back

in time let's think about this game that

we've got on a game of football nothing

more nothing less and a lot of people's

eyes but anybody that knows Spanish

we employed rivalries this is the

pinnacle the zenith kind of to

historical socio-economic clashes we

will see how it turns out the al-majid

come in probably their best run of form

he's in he's also though we'll stop them

take a look at her starting lineups

again brought to you by soccer calm it

is MSM a hunt who sketches down in pain

and he's not the only one it's a very

ball like Pepe it reaches in here right

there the boss clipped clear don't look

as if there's too much there I would

imagine that they'll be your kid there's

a little bit of a step that misses the

ball and catches Susie on the calf and

then it was a tumble I think they'll go

for your care as I said happiest man

come in arguably on the best uptick of

form under Zidane fill the last four

games they have looked as if they're

getting a whole ship tightened up

together a little maybe Sherman took the

tweets but certainly sure that Sergio

Sergio Busquets and he looks as if he's

paying now

Marcelo both of these teams going with

their star lineups a star turn for

rocket engine for muscle

back to novice some of the barsa fans

wanting a back pass it was a good

defensive boy from Modric yet seeing

that Messi it identified niyama who had

peeled a whip on that far side from

carvajal real effort but good cover from

Luca

I need that sort of cover all game long

you can prevent them as much as anything

you'll need the vaunted BBC to be on the

same page in a big way we all know that

MSN at USA for Barcelona have been in

operatic language form so the air flag

teasing that man with the offside flag

very coarse when the balls played in

lifetime

let's take a look war too bad call Phil

but the Marcelo on this side he's

keeping him at least a yard on when the

ball is touched even Sergio Ramos in the

middle seems to be on the wrong side of

Suarez

[Applause]

for Tony Crow starting lineup questions

Rea maybe not that many as we see an

offside flag against bail on the far

flake not that many for Barcelona other

than perhaps the insertion of Andres

Iniesta with a huge match against it let

it go on the horizon but for Real Madrid

so many wondering whether zinedine

zidane would put in kissimmee dough at

the expense of hummus he has how does

that change Real Madrid well it gives

him the balance that everybody's being

torn about leading up it's taken the

whole while to wake up to the fact that

if they're going to start playing with

baby say and they're the untouchables

you're going to need a stay at home

central defender they've got it in

casimiro he's going to have to have one

of the best games of his life here today

and be like the little Dutch boy

covering all the holes in the day

everywhere because you know that this

midfield of Barcelona will be in support

their midfield have got it beautifully

choreographed rocket ajikko sketching

and yesterboard the fan supporting MSN

so we'll see Samira with a little push

in the back but he would get away with

it but no Alejandro hernández

the man in the middle with the whistle

tittle nobody no Jose Tom cut down the

flanks and Alexander allemande the

fourth official that's just the type of

challenge that we homage we do not want

casimiro a little bit too anxious a

little bit too wound up diving into a

believing your chance of getting it's

one thing being an aggressive but he

better pick and choose when he launches

in against these super sharp Barcelona

he has in front of him pick your poison

se will drag defense with him trying to

get it back deflected by Benzema where

it could have been dangerous close out

by bends in - rehearsed fear that they

go away from the green as is the

situation with Barcelona all the time

ignoring the ball into the box playing

it back for Mascherano of all people for

a killer pass that was well covered by

Benzema them are now on the right wing

Messi using him in Suarez has gone out

wide left rocketed a six minutes in fill

it's been all Barcelona that could be a

bit of rope adored by the royal weights

they've got their own lethal

counter-attack we touch and dani álvarez

deflecting off the head of Messi just

missing the mark

there's an album two planks BK and

Mascherano in the middle of course match

you out now with that meniscus injury

and it's going to keep him sidelined for

maybe a month and a half

sit down of course has the benefit of it

fully rested and fit Benzema and gareth

bale not quite the same for Barcelona's

front three after all the extra emails

that they're covered in the South

American world could qualify as how much

of a difference will lap make we all

look sharper than a pin here nice play

now go to the ground seemed to get

tangled with Alves the fans don't agree

but the referee a lot closer yeah it's a

good call by the referee and Danny

coming through flipping the angles of

the dark in Theodore may 39 straight

matches without defeat for Barcelona

that's also on the docket a date in the

history books bale offside again and the

really playing these lanes very tight

all of the forwards for board teams

sitting on the shoulder and gambling

take a look again this again looks a

very very close call Phil when the ball

is hitting you in there again and for me

is still fastest it's don't you wear

dark matter

your maitre score to find out the

difference in a few of these offs a call

so who's going to be the first to blink

love the way the forwards are hauling

the run because they know they've got

the players that wonderful mutant flies

eye vision in the midfield defamed them

over the top knockout which gets a shot

such wide

comes novice to make the stop

then the elusive run dictating the past

beautifully nobody picking him up

nice ball play it in over that distance

again Jordi Alba so assured by

rocketship sneaks it inside nicely

Massimino pura wets away seem to get

tangled and

Paulo which is full I'm him as he's been

around there

[Music]

well cleared by Cristiano stll down the

line

two cuts inside Alba's in comes BK down

goes Cristiano

his initial turn was absolutely

brilliant right the challenge of Ramos

has to be one name I missed it this

isn't astonishing this if it's brilliant

from them are yummy against Ramos who's

arguing against the earlier fan is

calling it from the earlier one as you

see a field but the briga where the sets

the table for probably the worst finish

you'll see in a long long time I'll

clean it up right here and you'll see

the contact Suarez comes in to the ball

is nothing there absolutely nothing near

Marcis the square man running and then

all of his certain Suarez's victory is

squid that is amazing

again wonderful turn it says your

reverses which is anything that's doing

the throwing on Suarez and didn't seem

this as much there but it was it well

Donald Trump here could have a finish by

Suarez amazing

[Applause]

touched wide rocketed

they'll be I've been saying it for some

time regarding Suarez's opportunities

over this last dozen games in La Liga I

saw he's been missing some chances that

I was critical of and sometimes it's

just amazing how the easiest of

opportunities become the more difficult

one he had so much time and space to

just touch it home i given go rocket

egde back towards Messi the suaveness

got it now there's whistles it again the

near Mars well wonderful clear by name

are in just putting it on it called

ignore in got of a alter for him whereas

I think near mark could had a good kiss

for taking the shot himself but he knew

was a hundred percent certainty that

Suarez would put it away

did not I just clipped the defense Alba

stepping up here's Iniesta again the

fact at his age now

31 in Atletico on the horizon probably

not a 90-minute stretch for any esta but

it is a deep bench

or barcelona wasn't always that way this

year again Alejandro hernández with the

whistle it's a tight ball in from Messi

but he knows it's Sergey busquets

arguably the best OneTouch player in all

of Barcelona including the number 10 I

was pacing a little bit but again risk

and reward

as it always is with Barcelona

stellar season for mr. Chiquita this

year and he was a bit off the boil last

year messing with the touch up steps

morgridge another foul this time against

Real Madrid in the real fractious game

hasn't it but with all of the petty

fouls in the offs a cause and still

Barcelona looking up with that score

Lane thinking that they would be and you

may regret it

Epping up Pepe but his pass out for

Benzema need to make an adjustment on

that one it's right back to Barcelona

to vote you as it have been an

absolutely tremendous form as well or

Bravo or C X colo-colo man Chilean

international but even his brilliance

this year being upstaged by the customer

say feel nervous and need him here today

by the looks in the opening thirty

minutes he'll has lived up to the

pressure every time he's been called

upon saving the bacon of Real Madrid

over and over every game he'll come up

with a save the bald stupefy

[Applause]

this world-class central defender being

as good as I've ever seen him play as

well at our PTA paired with Macedon Oh

many thought there would be no replacing

puyol and arguably they've had to share

that low but a lot of it has gone right

to the Argentine shoulders

[Applause]

and going back to that total football

theme they still haven't listed as a

midfielder three years on actually four

years on since Pep Guardiola started the

experiment

fans

under pressure

foul against Ronaldo Neymar puts out his

own fair is the price for Klaus fights

down for a few moments - Jordan standing

next to Joseph but he about Camille with

his son

even Florentino Perez taking part yeah

with the long flow from the under tree

through the heat to return the tributes

as well he's handled this with true

class the young madrid president

let's see in what sounds

[Applause]

side of the boom wizard into the path of

bale tries to square and pique makes the

block and triples to Bravo again as I

said this will clasp Lee at the back

cannot be kendama playing as good as

what he's done lately at ball allowing

gonna steal in donut red shade and

Gareth just too quick for Jordi Alba

wonderful run from Gareth bill but

tremendous cover across that put out the

danger towards Cristiano and Benzema

good look at Zuzu he's been on the

playing side of this course it was Rafa

beneath says when these two teams met

earlier this season didn't quite work

out that well for Real Madrid he in

sports calm there's the chance to share

your thoughts on Twitter and we would

love to hear from you and don't forget

hash tag El Clasico inside from Alves

slips through for SWAT a small sends it

for name art on caught of a high back

for the yes time his shot carried away

by Ramos and wonderful selection from

absolutely not perfect ignoring the

one-on-one and seeing the cutback

beautiful ball for a serrano to have a

spank mr to the inside sneaks it in for

a messy tried to lay it back smart from

Cana maja well play it it was tricky

dealt with it beautifully dani alves

read the spin

[Applause]

Plato's kind of touched Marcin wasn't

stopped though messy in the center of

the park and as he sang through and he

gets to the trying with it back

it's our first booking the Suarez takes

a blade initially and then the second

one comes out for the elusive Easter

again R is a sharp passing from

Barcelona questioning classes here's the

first one that's a direct kick through

cover help from carbohydrate through

Suarez here

opportunity to play the ball and then

the second one is even worse Carbajal

Zubin yellow card

unable to contain the path as much as

the control

[Applause]

Penida the football from Barcelona that

they're passing over that distance you

look extremely sharp the first caution

of the match number of Hondas starting

the wheel

[Applause]

trying to bring it home but over novices

net Mendez this is 21st appearance only

his third full season as a top-flight

ref in Spain average is about four

yellows a match only six ejections on

the season but he has pointed to the

spot nine times in those 20 matches you

kind of sense a penalty might be the

difference here

here's Ronaldo tries to split two decks

as he and in the yes to collide Fairplay

says the referee now it's 3v6 tackle and

up steps Casa Mito

oh speaking of stepping up its rockets

Trotter's he'll pay back in time

Travis to save Real Madrid again

tremendously my Suarez and then it

enforced the racket each and then the

last thing of a shock this is going out

of quit wreckage absolutely sizzles this

one in that mine again

kill analyst the Costa Rican comes to

the rescue

what

[Applause]

clearance by Pepe he doesn't get

anywhere near touch your distance in

rocket ditch and then this black cat

lives up to the strip that live nation'

used to wear and complemented

beautifully brilliant again from Kela

glancing header Ronaldo but it's

intercepted by pique and you talk about

that ray something we talked about in

the pregame record arrow bringing it up

don't want everyone talking about Gigi

Buffon and the man that used to patrol

the Nets here for Real Madrid and that

was iker casillas if it wasn't a Costa

Rican passport you kind of wonder how

great people would say novice is his

teammates have no doubt that a lie so

wonderful stop again a slow-motion

doesn't do it justice Phil that was

sizzled by the kouachi and international

we're in the number for blondie rocket

ditch

Samira definitely stickiness Sunnah and

the works of Barcelona number of times

yes sir over four PK grid bore you can

see that's around casimiro this time but

they play him to is right up steps Ramos

strong stepping by Ronaldo Benson man

out for cross no one to pass a to care

appeal cooking back

we're deep and that defensive setup part

Real Madrid and doing well but then when

Real Madrid gain possession and Ben's

him up Gareth not able to make up that

space

he's usually lives on that far right

hand side we up the field doing his

defensive duties well this is Cristiano

[Applause]

elbow on the overlap Neymar on his

inside down now that's what the fans

thought Casa meto in the neighborhood

I've been leaving his naughty

calling card payment I'm against doing a

good job lowest in itself for Neymar

pokes in Suarez

couldn't get over the ball beautiful

giving gore between you requiring in the

Brazilian but look at Messi's run as

well if we see this again it's a

wonderful given gore and Messi had ready

for the third pass coming in but Mr

decides to go for the strike home she is

absolutely the privilege of doing where

he's playing has been absolutely superb

so far Nima also asked from behind

[Applause]

almost getting us started back for

Marcelo Barcelona putting pressure on

Real Madrid in their own end outlets

almost

they'll trying to cut inside Alba but

couldn't it's a wonderful ball from Tony

cross and Alba hesitates for that split

second and Gareth beer winning like a

hungry vulture for that ball to settle

and it just gets whisked away from him

because he was one-on-one with Alba and

it wouldn't have been a contest have you

been able to win that ball in he would

have been in through on Claudio Bravo

with his piece just throwing into the

six outcomes bra or bobbles said he gets

there first overs with some space they

see Gareth Bale taking the moisture off

that

summer with the touch but it straight to

swaddles his pass may be deflected

behind Messi his Marcello's intervention

rather than a clear pass good covering

from the X flume on

[Applause]

[Music]

greevey three messy

[Applause]

and they might have a shower

the messies got wonderful support from

Suarez in Lima

[Applause]

buzzing noises got the defendant

declaration

[Applause]

take a look at the referee but is it the

right one and I mentioned he calls an

average of almost a penalty every other

game that's about as close as you can

get and it's messy who tends not to go

down

certainly and he's still arguing can I

believe it

take a look when we can it was very

close call I felt

fans letting their thoughts be known

here's mod rich Ronaldo screaming for it

has a good angle bends him on the middle

he can find him next decide Masha Donald

Xbox left foot parried by Bravo

Cristiano Ronaldo playing top-drawer

football a 31 year old Portuguese

they're in again ice from Margaret Sears

Canada ha Ronaldo in the middle if he

can find them sends it across Bale

Benzema flips it into PK trying to clear

bail on the left but he couldn't bring

that one

where is this shot straight this one

here's the replay and say to the box

it's a certain free kick but his no

penalty he's outside of the penalty area

but that's a tackle that comes on arm

Messi's knees with the ball norway

across now the question nursing is it

Sergio Ramos is gambling he knows he's

done but like a kipper here and he's got

no chance of containing Messi he

Gamble's outside in the boxing knew

where he was he gambled he won and how

huge would it have been Ramos already

with a yellow could have even been a

second there showed Phil 90 minutes left

to go Messi pops back up after casa

Meadows challenge

Neymar if there is a player on the

planet who is close to epitomizing what

coif used to be as a player it might

well be named

perhaps appropriate he's wearing the

Blaugrana two horses at work totally

different color gorilla my ice yellow

look it's out saying he knows that

message Dunham and he's just throwing up

the left foot roadblock

says yours left foot turns into a

machete and Messi makes no attempt to

dive his legs are taken and you can't

run without your legs and Sergio Ramos

knows the referee has a clear look at it

and goes Pepe Suarez's reputation may be

going

[Applause]

first caution against Barcelona and it

comes with a cost

measuring them up yeah a little forearm

to the chin although Pepe let's just say

he might be up for Best Supporting Actor

I don't know about that sure think

that's an intentional el borde in the

fierce focus on shoes where turns around

to find out with

Pepi is and you saw the action

look at this every chain and there you

see there's a touch of the ball before

it looked as if on all of the repairs

prior to that that he was knowing the

other ball but I'm not so much good

fortune there is there that when he's

trying to put his leg across I'm not

sure he was trying to clear the ball but

it's arguable now people in Pepys saying

yet my action was there which it was

okay with Tanglewood Bentham I'm getting

it Freda Busquets an eye beautiful pass

for Albert Suarez we'll miss the next

match against Laden al Sociedad that's

on the other side of their Atletico

Madrid opener in Champions League play

[Applause]

may not be the most expectant classical

but there's certainly been plenty for

the lads and lasses to talk about at

halftime

around the Bison living rooms of the

world a lot of controversy and offside

cause and open chances missed on free

kicks not called wonderful game right on

the edge after half an hour in for

Neymar again well defended by Modric ten

point gap to start all day chance on an

outlet and it's a full head of steam for

Gareth Bale

good one Bentham op bail Dex

maybe maybe

but instead its Mascherano in the book -

tremendous position this one by either

Gareth or Cristiano Mascherano comes

across with a slate tackle and digs the

player

not one less of a controversy much

around or noise got to get there real

quick he has the left elbow comes in

through jackknife tape of action and

good call by the rest of my ice now take

a look at this it's just a hair under 35

yards out a long way a bit of distance

but Ronaldo has quite the leg looks as

if it's going to be cr7 with his five

step back and good sling up pause now

what's going on at the other end novice

and Carvajal of the center circle

Christiano step in the big

Dan's against the big teams of lids but

here he knows this is a wonderful of

activity the ones in he practices all we

Bravo can thank his lucky stars

all superstars on each side of this

footballing pitch being presented with

opportunities that there usually are a

lot more closer to the net but as you

see important of us and Bravo saying

relief

all goes the other way Marcello tried to

dribble through 15 minutes left to go in

this opening half right no you're not a

huge fan of statistics let alone math

but a 10-point gap

eight games left to go in some ways

taking the pressure of the title out

these two teams just get a chance to

play at rank

yep putting your ties from that your age

field and look as if the playing with

really good abandoned Real Madrid been

defending as best they can with the

three forwards as well keeping this

score laying down and starting to creep

back into the game now Real Madrid

starting to leave the long grass and

coming up and hunting

[Applause]

for anything Gareth feel on that far say

probably more than Cristiano on this say

they can't see that matchup against

Jordi Alba a little bit more than work

out too well for Marc Bartra in recent

memory and

Jamaa with a poor touch maybe go and see

who skates and then

nutmeg this playthrough Benzema as if

this giveaway it wasn't embarrassing

enough all-time matches between these

two it's 264 including the friendlies

barcelone a little bit better in those

unofficial matches back in the early

days 109 wins 296 in La Liga play it's

71 for Real Madrid and 68 for Barcelona

32nd minute ticking to a close

baker's dozen left to go

Mr out why tries to come in cuz album

were ball again by Jordi Alba leads to

this before Albert right in the perfect

position mascherano didn't need to play

it in depends him as feet did he he were

wonderful cows field hang the back lane

he has to stripped that space and sand

off your forward tasteful in this bill

would speed you get it gets to it with

the outside of that gifted left nice to

drive it in but Alba was ready a sonido

our cell oh the left back over on the

right wing and he looks a good pass

inform Aldrich Duncan might not like him

let's he Don loves him

and here's Marcelo again tried to drive

a crew busquets but now out of position

all

lifting it forward a chance for name on

the imagine in full retreat yeah but

they over Oh Pepe in nice tackle I

brazilian-born Portuguese and Amanda's

reading of Neymar there and wonderful

intervention by the Portuguese mind on

the Brazilian solo again

around Alves dropped to the top of the

box late to the party was bailed from

sirs-e busquets in his own penalty area

with three white shirts in there if he

doesn't get that touched and bounced up

to him cool is the seed inside the

cucumber again Busquets

eight year old rocketed out of that

great Croatian side gearing up for the

euros that's in the future to be a hero

here today excuse me and choked up 35th

minute

a TMT sideline reporter Kevin Egan at

the camp no Kevin what did you see it's

interesting Phil I'm sitting about 20

yards from Luis Enrique every single

time the official on this near side

ventures for as the halfway line Luis

Enrique is giving him an earful about

that penalty incident in the 24th minute

clearly he and his assistant as well

Vaughn Carlos in do I feel that that was

an absolute penalty to Barcelona that

was not given they're both wrong Kevin

tell you that because it was outside in

the box and it was a little touch on the

ball by Sergio Ramos although I don't

think he meant it I think he managed to

tick Messi down and in that action he

cleat seems to touch the ball but very

close thought it was a free kick for

sure like any good manager though trying

to use it to his image for later net

well set felt but it's written off the

ball by Ronaldo up steps Alves to win it

back or chance on the far flight now for

Iniesta I sleep touch Suarez the defect

deflection goes though towards Alba who

can't control in the throw and Priscilla

a great fill wasn't the best of balls

from Suarez the intention was a hundred

percent rate feeding in an EMR who had a

couple of yards in front of his defender

doesn't find him a shadow no rocketing

in on that throw in to steal it back

rocketed far side me

cool night you see a few jackets in the

background temperature just above 63 and

call this little late coming back and a

good step up by Pepe I'm father how

autism oh good humor in this split

hasn't been a dirty game at all but

contentious it has Ross - Marcella

looking long but Alba plays it perfectly

my solana founded in 1899 Real Madrid

three years later in fact just

celebrating their 100 and 14th

anniversary at the start of this month

and this width here from personal

allowing Messi to drop back into that

danger areas dani alves pushes up weight

grid ball such thought with danger there

was little dagger balls at Busquets

players but every one of them's like a

last start of a hundred near d he

overruns the ball collision behind the

play looked like it might have been a

kick to the knee Hernandez could have

left this one run but elects to stop the

play or a stinger we hope

[Applause]

it's a collision of the knees Messi

reaching in and you're see right here

the knee comes rape casimiro no

intention there by alien El Rey remember

earlier this season it was the reverse

of that against Pedro Regas that not

messy out for two months or rather

innocuous challenge not different but

the point is well beard well taken mr.

noodle still a little limp as he tries

to make sure everything's in the right

place seven minutes and change left to

go in regulation I think he'd be happy

to get into this locker room with this

score lane the threat that his team have

produced

[Music]

still looking for the go-ahead goal but

it defended as well as he could

against the Barcelona team that isn't

doing too much wrong could have been so

different don't wait for the lads in the

locker room to see half tank sure rather

though that miss I'm Suarez because that

is the biggest of all of the

controversies here in this game so far

unreleased and strive for bail but BK

under pressure just plays it out Damon

to the ball here from Marcelo and Gareth

Milla pours it the intention was

beautifully executed until again Gerard

piqué covering here there and everywhere

he said was just one of their last seven

in league at home against Real Madrid

that was back in 2012 looking for the

flick she netted the near post moving in

at that near six had it clear by Alvez

top of the box for named arm

would cover kind of a hog

all the way back

and ascending it long but

in position seasons to be made one of

them was this Casa Mito in the starting

lineup and Hamas Rodriguez to the bench

and they wanting an offside

100 million dollar man a spectator maybe

still an impact to make always impactful

Columbian absolutely brilliant in the

World Cup qualifiers what

[Applause]

his covering jobs and he does it again

and he needs to do it here

it's a magisterial pass from Messi rated

astrayed and they think they've got

another Hornung call nothing given again

the madness of Messi's ingenuity simply

insane brilliant pass and Cristiano

doing his cover work very well like

Jordi showing Barcelona president joseph

marco mayo on his cellphone this is what

my dad used to do the suspicion of the

hall door on mr. Yano but he knew the

pass was so impeccable that he had to do

something take another look at it a half

tame or chipped in over everyone

deflected though rocketed a chance our

solo out a good header don't casimiro

Nardo flips it DK trying to come over

behind Benzema

don't forget the Express halftime show

brought to you by the redesign

volkswagen passat nadine Zidane doing a

pretty good job redesigning this Real

Madrid a far cry from what we saw of the

better the Bayeux just a few months ago

yeah changes lane loops from time to

time looking for the right formula it's

got a good balance here two deer in

Reston came here from The Illusionist

that goes surround wants it back

Neymar in but over Messi target

mozillian cannot resist this and who can

blame him it's a bouncing ball he's got

the spear sintang it was just his

gyroscope near Marcis the innovate at

that far corner and Danny just kind of

catch that half volley sweet enough to

keep the ball staredown worthy a temple

still scoreless three minutes

we have not seen a scoreless halftime in

league play

since going back to 2011 to stop one on

two degrees of separation that costs

Dani Alves the opportunity of bursting

the net by sealing a couple of feet over

just one or two degrees I haven't seen a

scoreless half of the camp know in a

classic Oh since 2009 when Ebro scored

the game winner in the second half

pretty big weekend himself for PSG all

in PK out ribbon Benzema but he could

not duplicate his form this time it's

why and again we've seen this brilliant

Frenchman put these away with his hands

over his eyes but this time he's like a

fish up a tree with this finish where we

over can it adjust it down and he would

love to see that opportunity come back

he will tonight in his dreams

now keeping a few numbers back do not

want to surrender a goal before the

break if they can avoid it what a sonido

got the ball and Neymar

needed to get that one name our door

stood by him look out first of speed

from bale deflected cross it's out for a

corner in a chance for a al not sure

that casimiro will get more important

chuckles to make and he thinks it's a

foul again for me

or just going to all sorts of

conniptions and loving what he sings

from 10:00 to 10:00 a good opportunity

here Sergio Ramos will be the target but

he's got another big man that will feel

Benzema passing here or knockout rose if

a rocket it's flying in and he steps on

rubbles in the process but it was Ramos

who seemed to be knocking the Croatian

off BAM this as well comes across here

really rocket it's because he says

Sergio Ramos winding up to push this one

away from not mistaken Phil Sergio Ramos

strikes through on a ball that he thinks

is going to meet that left foot right

foot take a look again all sorts of

pushing and shoving it happens all the

time

this won't be the opportunity you were

looking for Sergio Ramos yeah was up for

it than that

breathe defending by rocket ditch in the

follow-through from Sergio Ramos with

that right leg catches the Croatian if

Iran doesn't get there that time up one

would have been catapulted horn by the

Spanish World Cup winner Ramos

not a parrot seven a very quiet

impressive game is the number four for

barsa working as he always does himself

into the ground but it's the wonderful

cerebral clear as well plus he's got the

heart the size of a pig

I see with only about 40 seconds of

added time left

rocket ish but it turned left and it

looks like Keylor Navas and Claudio

Bravo will be able to keep the sheets

clean course cool here and he's got

two players running in saving the box as

always near Martin Suarez but who is for

the top corner well aware coming up to

half tame Phil get myself into the

oxygen attacked in a wonderful pulsating

qiyam I need a few spare tanks before

this one is over well that's going to do

it for the opening half both teams with

chances keepers getting the job done

though and at the cap no we are

scoreless at the break back with more as

our Volkswagen Express halftime show

comes your way plenty to recap plenty to

look forward to

[Music]

[Applause]

[Music]

back to the booth with Phil Shane and

Ray Hudson with more on the first half

thanks guys and as we get set for the

start of this second half ray we haven't

seen quite that classical fire yet yeah

yeah it's more like a regular sort of La

Liga game in my eyes it's been a

wonderful contentious game great skill

wonderful opportunities plenty of missed

chances plenty of controversy so it's

got it all I've got a feeling that

something's going to give you know

somebody's going to get sent off and

somebody's going to scores the falter

looks down let's take a look at the

sidelines of the Camp Nou with another

AT&T sideline check Kevin Egan what you

got

indeed Phil I heard Andres Cordero at

the break talked about Real Madrid

potentially playing with fire and

looking at the body language of zinedine

zidane throughout the first half he

obviously doesn't think so he remains

quite emotionless the only time Zhi Zhu

has gotten quite active with his

emotions was when Pepe needlessly gave

the ball away and one other time when

the ball was played across two Benzema

and he stayed over the bar Aziz you gave

a wry look and nearly talked to himself

you know maybe I would have scored that

now as the second half gets set to get

underway who will be the hero who will

be the goat as plenty of superstars out

there to make the difference I think

there's going to be a goal or two in

this second novel but Real Madrid

who's got the bench it could perhaps

make a difference later on in this game

as well so when your thrills and spills

twists and turns ups and downs just like

the way we like it

0-0 at the half first time that's

happened to the cap know since 2009 and

he has to infer busquets back to Macedon

oh and they keep the ball moving

wonderful reaching from Mascherano

earlier begin possession for barsa in a

very even game in terms of the

possession without

drops it back messy with a little

becomes the bunch of novice straight to

Ronaldo oh well clean by killing of us

there didn't quite get the height and

distance taking over the driving wheel

away from Sergio Ramos look as if he was

just gonna head it clear where's mother

easily dispossessed on that chance

Marcello drops it back now it's Ramos

under pressure Neymar a chance to take

advantage but can't Pepe tries to

dribble through free and gives up the

ball aim our minds a little gap splits

the two midfielders and cousin

Margaret's on

whistle from the man that counts this

became

dog thought about hunting now turn again

it's whatõs

now Ramos already has one

that's what Marshalls arguing about but

you can imagine it's just amazing from

the referee it's wonderful from even

rocket kick ahead of this and that is a

clear foul and arguably an easy call for

the referee to make for the yellow card

and we cannot believe it either

wonderful dexterity on the run by niyama

having his defenders stretched out

across like a wonderful lane of white

linen and tiptoeing through the tulips

was near ma but and the World Cup

winners having to be it about that last

challenge then Sousa Rama is very very

fortunate to get away with that one Phil

there's a big bracket hitch it set it up

beautifully for Suarez a grid turned by

the requiring again and can this man

it's justice

Jerry school how's it going to be sambar

tang

[Applause]

Messi drives it towards that upper

corner but no real need to sweat by

novice again his high standards Oakley

is frogs breath

[Applause]

it's a second grid looked at the door

hasn't had one on targets very

uncharacteristic from VNL last time a

classic Oh ended scoreless back in 2002

November of 2002 zinedine zidane a

player for Rihanna Britain's Enrique a

player for Barcelona at that time but

neither took part in that match day

their first classic o against each other

as managers you see at the top of the

screen from history between the two

coaches as well knew Jim Egan Zuzu and

those cleaned is that your tornado bar

that's a good turn again nicely covered

this time I was quick off the line but

Ramos didn't want where he was two men

in this technical areas they were at

each other's throat when they used to

play against each other you see it's all

forgotten about now you see the pictures

of the challenges from one another is

one in particular there with zoo zoo has

Bucheon Ricky by

[Applause]

do not actually scored in his first two

classic rows Andreessen Rica followed up

of a game-tying goal the next year

only on the Warriors today I send a

change between NES that and Messi been

going on throughout this game very

difficult confusing the Real Madrid

holding three just being pretty much a

lot this game awesome you know 120

crossing tote touch by name are again

SWAT has tripped up or hop steps

consummate over the phone Neymar

thanks with his wife back to his left

impermissible just behind and bail back

on defense

hustle by Alba Modred's

trying to keep up with Neymar rocketed

and Ronaldo pounces when he claims

Neymar trying to keep up with himself as

well changes his name so many times it's

a good ball and for Benzema takes it off

the chest down Zhong ke ke Lola shot

goes to art rebound Marcela when it's

blocked away

stornes defending from barcelona

brilliant from the frenchman picks it up

and sees his options and fancies himself

one on one against DK who reads him

beautifully and again top class it's a

wonderful turn again keep him coming

look up again for cross Dawei top of the

box it's daddy Alma's grabbing his face

nothing the mouth here I believe and

some of the rolling around has got the

base said it's a little bit we're going

to see over the top but then you see the

elbow and their arm pulling rate across

from Ramos and it's fully into the face

of the side of dani alves slow motion

doesn't look much like anything but life

came runs coming up swinging with

opportunity again for the weights once

again another inner swinger Bravo a yard

off his life

changes things up dropping atomos for

mortgage of the Flex

[Applause]

to go back heel flick by Gareth Bale

this clamps for the offside it's not

given but fortunately for Barcelona OD

or Bravo hit read it beautifully

take a look hit by Modric Gareth Bale in

an offside position for sure but watch

the Ibaka Dabra it's a good effort by

Gareth even though he is off step and he

has to wanted it more

it is messy 499 career goals to the turn

they had the space behind and Messi

historic 50th for Argentina

solo keeps it going quickly to smart

ball to d5 but it's Benzema and ronaldo

sleep bale trailing market it's back but

he can't get there

tremendous covering again from the

coalition recognizing the one-on-one is

too much the enjoy the easy clip and

call by like a kitchen inst the

Brazilian some you know a target

rocketed jogging into the path now again

it's messy I've never been 49 goals

career for varsa we'd love to dedicate

another one to Johan Cruyff but Royale

has something else in mind as he may

have as well sooner cleaner within a

gear of himself Philippi a flake from

the amount of energy put in for

Argentina certainly looks as if it's

taking a bit of a toll on Leonel I share

trying to shut down the Frenchman get

some help I haven't seen much of kind of

a hard pushing forward

and decide to do with msn yeah

discipline young madrid expense clear

canford school has keeps it in but

coming over to cover with

brilliant play from swaddles it was

again no more jumps in front of Pepe

the fourth minute ticking down the ball

in for Messi as an angle Messi in for

Suarez

for messing top of the box

plus again from Costa Rica bond s he

looks at him and says he's not human

this is an amazing sea

it continued

[Applause]

Kilis gracias Neil screeches Laurie City

Nayla Booga what a great effort Phil

absolutely absolutely

much hysteria with the effort and the

save was Magisterial I this will swing

away in for an Aldo to clear but

actually the sets got their birds the

early part of this game I've been

singing this much praise is all day long

that he will come up with saves like

this to take your breath away and to put

your jaw on the ground this isn't just

international class this is his class

this is all world class from the

back and what it gone

from Leonel inswinger for

the dawn rocket is

Ramos combined just as well he gets

there because there's a frog's hair

between this bull fainting color how and

fainting peaky

Hey look at that

messy

little wrecking ball flowing into

peppier they're full of intention and

mice from messy

[Applause]

[Music]

[Applause]

fresh Sebastian

and he punishes the next

it's bad depending

and out they get good care and he

goes kill at this school a

wonderful wonderful Heather down and

dirty he goes he bounces it in like the

Barnes Wallis bomb the demise convention

Real Madrid punished Barcelona I've been

trying to punish Real Madrid downstairs

but this time they go up but they tries

to get close to him and Big E says I'll

see on the other side wonderful feeling

a way lake dish you on the toilet roll a

peek here he's got a nanosecond and it

produces a terabyte of still

he's been having a great game

defensively in in the and Isis to

helmetless MSN I'll show them how to do

it

[Applause]

he finds a little gap volutes consummate

o2 Neymar

gets his backside in the way Neymar just

can't find enough rainbow on that pass

to take it over the top of Marcel winter

capisce

the breakthrough goal coming from the

beheaded boy Niki Sanders would we're

back his little boy and Shakira it's a

wonderful hello and telling you he

probably knows a chemical upstairs with

this header in angle it horizontally

I've gotta go down and he bounces it the

tape

your chance even for the Costa Rica man

the greatest gear for the greatest game

in the world at soccer calm second goal

of the season for PK Raqqa ditch puts it

in perfectly

here

I said there was a golden ray

is there a second off in Buddhist

as you say - Don getting his man home

built a good skill lay on top of the box

as it trickles to grade ball

[Applause]

attention he goes past him doesn't go

down easily but then again the cover

behind racket Kitsch is impeccable from

the blow-dryer shirts payment aim again

whether it's Gareth Benzema or Christian

or after they get past the first clear

barcelona insurance policy and defense

has been tremendous

not what clear

concept the mall got each other's backs

what response no from seed and then

transfer Albers shooting a bit more than

in recent years not quite back to his

Sevilla days we'll pass it off this time

gets messy with the goal Barcelona be a

bit more patient

not steal against Roma is not the only

Derby of note the classical hitting

Spaniard against Spaniard or against

Catalan

to check out being sports.com for

details

the South Florida

an ASL debut later today strikers

against Miami linkage a child why here's

Alvis 30 minutes to go

23 straight unbeaten in La Liga 39

straight unbeaten overall best unbeaten

streak in Spanish history Oh what again

from Busquets Suarez drops it back from

Messi back for the other Brian lifting

it trove of good cover by Ramos

wonderful set up by Messi for Suarez in

it's an invading value that you

yes

football Sergey busquets

[Applause]

vintage

because amazingly Suarez didn't launch

through that ball fell after the

wonderful set of by Messi seein Pepe

renewing acquaintances bail it

dispossessed Albert

Iniesta

that would not expect to see a full 90

from dawn Andres but he's still out

there

Atletico Madrid the looming around

arise and of course maybe a slightly

easier tilt Real Madrid but they will be

on the road against Wolfsburg I think

being your main fill is a top-class

analyst commented but I'll tell you what

it's the farthest thing from these

players mains is it the furthest from

Luis Enrique who has to field in 11 I

think so

confidence breeds confidence in the way

his team of grid here so far is want to

be enriching to them but we are Madrid

will never see a dye guns Marcelo good

run nextly inside second touch he's a

boss deflected

[Applause]

slices it home to turn the game up

Justin sei

[Applause]

the brilliant Marcelo it's gotta pull it

home my big bands beautifully and he

needs no help this time he needs help

make a shot needs a dentist but it's all

Marcelo for me it's wonderful he draws

up a lot alone at the fenders in it

takes a deflection fortunately right

here take a look Jordi Alba gets the

assist he can't cut it out

it takes a bloop and it's brilliant by

bends that one stays ground level pique

cuts it out yep but what a run look at

the genesis of that Gaul again from the

ex lumen ends here man been wonderful

cutting across invading the challenges

that weren't coming

they're just forcing Marcelo Wade and

that was all kid and that led to the

gore this gets in from Messi shipping it

in from Neymar stops

way offside flag comes up again as

elusive as an eel covered in Vaseline

NEMA he can it pick him up it's like

trying to pick up water wonderful

Jackrabbit Pierce very very close to

being offside here when the Falls

cleared and possibly was and the rate

decision again by a few inches after

touch back for alders

maybe Yohan upstairs wanted to see a

little bit more magic from this

classical encounter knotted up at one

won't see a goal for 56 minutes we see

two and seven who is never satisfied

that's for sure

sounding like a man who had to deal with

him a few times yeah it against the

great man and something that you'll

never forget greatest football player

that played against updated against a

lot of the greats bestie Pelle

Beckenbauer nobody late Krause

Oh forward by Qasim Edo Benzema battling

for it but no wonderful execution wasn't

it from Benzema it's got to make his

mind up in a nanosecond and really

produced a wonderful acrobatic finishing

hits it clean with malice me Esther Alba

on his horse just at a shoe to it a

little too far for Neymar though sonido

under pressure could not find bail who's

been rather invisible in the second half

maybe through no fault of his own again

the lead up for modrich and then there

comes off the back heel of Alba who

absolutely pounds into the ground

it can't nor the can of limb he care

really either because the blue takes it

away from what he had expected to be the

ball played in and at Slade deviation in

the air set the table for Kareem and the

cream rises to the top again inside for

Iniesta when he first goal for Ben Zoma

tying his

watermark in Spain still in the race for

the Pichichi all those looks away mines

messy hangs it in the air for Alva Alva

kind of a how to come away with it out

of a hob sees it poked away and it's out

time now for an AT&T sideline check

here's Kevin Egan yes Phil and a

reminder to go to Twitter and vote on

our poll should Luis Suarez I've

received a red card for the elbow on

Pepe earlier in the match do get your

vote in there and a quick thought on the

Barcelona corner go from pk

the assistant coach Luis Enriquez

assistant coaches name is Juan Carlos

moon zuy

he steps up in place of Luis Enrique for

every set play a free-kick around the

goal and also a corner that was not an

accident that was purposely by design

Neymar came across and when all the

players were celebrating after BK scored

the goal Javier Mascherano ran across to

warn Carlos and zuy and congratulated

him back to you Phil on the defensive

side maybe no congratulations though as

they see the deflection up and buried

thanks Kevin

one one the score at the camp nope all

level at the end of 90 if this score

holds just one step closer towards a

title Marcille ona 23 time champions

force Real Madrid with a record 32

almost two slaughters but Pepe contorts

himself good comeback

coming twenty in him there's another

look at that bran ball that feigns the

pot of gold that is called Karim Benzema

no chance for pikia he stretches his

eyebrows to get it and just can it get

that touch that would have taken away

from Ben's as trying to force his way

free kind of a house soars over Busquets

Iniesta an errant touch the first of the

match

[Applause]

smacks that one to midfield Bale uses

his speed draws masha Donal out of

position back to the middle this is

where Bale likes it they're overloaded

on that that's his two bends him up back

for Bale left foot press and he needed

to put more on it easy for Bravo yep it

really stepped through that and sizzled

that one horn but was for the placement

instead of the power understandably so

perhaps but easy pickings for boss a man

would build up that from Real Madrid

again him very level very level we

response from the royal weights in

Cristiano still leave his finger prints

is this it

he's our because all the

the flag coming up Reynaldo a wonderful

Cristiano

he tries to hold his horizontal run and

he wins and whit's you don't see it

there but Christiana was running he good

15 20 yards before and when it was in

the possession of Ben Tzion our wedding

for that invitation to be presented any

would have started his run but again

split second off with the taming chance

on the turn Suarez keeps his balance but

can't keep the ball 70th minute reached

talked about that potential read against

Suarez there could be just too much of

an argument that's Sergio Ramos had two

chances for a second yellow so if quite

apt Alejandra Hernandez he's I guess

impartial II blind I think really

egregious here a good step up by Ramos

but he forgot something

Messi trying to find the nutmegs through

says you Ramos to feint Suarez who was

still on the ground thought Messi was

going to go solo their transfer Alvers

against his compatriot Marcelo Messi

knocks it down slice slams it down maybe

a deflection but it's wide of novices

net and lowly little knockdown header by

Messi to feign Suarez and his left foot

meets a bouncing ball that's a great

cover by Cassidy arrow would be a corner

absolutely

I'm soloing up 20 minutes away even from

a draw from extending its unbeaten

streak to 40 which would tie Nottingham

Forest on the all-time list back in the

glory days of Brian Clough over the

cross novice stays back

Neymar saying what did I do

by the way all-time mark Celtic with 62

unbeaten but that was way back in 1915

nothing there till historic for

Barcelona and they're not done yet

[Applause]

join again finding that pocket in the

middle when although unable to get past

Alves

[Applause]

harder to Don loosening up on the

sidelines we wonder again with Atletico

looming other es Tuesday might be done

although sneaks it in bail but on his

right foot elects to lay it off

and to nestle needle with a draw keep

the momentum from Madrid give them the

slave heartbeat wouldn't it but now they

need the full three they're going to see

their confidence again late this point

will be taken at all but even think

about a draw because he isn't and he is

definitely not coming open

really bravely taking the game to

Barcelona leaving themselves high

stretched

despite the lightning that is waiting up

front

[Applause]

73rd minute has stood on hands over his

card I just move out seems to have been

on that Barcelona bench forever

don't forget the NASL debut on be in

sports the South Florida Derby with look

Miami against the strikers be in sports

for all the NASL news to Fort Lauderdale

Strikers you guys went away to Minnesota

for a while but that was a while ago

maybe at City full mention might be back

in MLS play nice chance now for Ronaldo

gets it back let's go from the cap no

unlucky from Benzema to feigned

cristiano just checking his run is the

rape pass for the rape man and lucky

young Madrid final touch for any ester

Baraka dish as well head bail on this

right hand side as well one on one

matching it in but they can't control

and micellar just makes a towards the

dark having support camp nor here near

ma it just pops away from him

wonderful play again from Lea now this

rock addiction will be coming out yeah

he has poured himself into this key

everything some serious work better hit

the ground running he has been

phenomenal in this game and pause for me

not loud enough tremendous performance

here comes the Turk maybe for the final

cut

but imagine this means that any esto

will be in a supplementary role against

torrents old Atleti midweek has not been

a glorious debut or should we say half a

debut put on and without both having to

spend half a season in mothball title by

Tony crush there and just doing enough

to touch that one past messy away from

Messi all sort of been serious problems

and consequences there well played

tuning cross chance for Alves burst of

speed from Tehran but he'll cut back

poke free nicely by Casa Mito again yeah

what's gonna getting a little sloppy

with some of their pasta sauce to talk

about sloppy quickly nodded down Neymar

Suarez but it was poked away

appealing for a corner he's not going to

get it then his sharpness isn't the be

debated even doted for a split second he

gets a weird the space and good

last-second intervention by Pepe but he

cannot mobility by Suarez this is fresh

now as it was in the first minute

causing ramos and Pepe all sorts of

problems but I'm saying that part of the

hardest adjustment to Barcelona is he's

having to play a different game than the

one he played with Atletico he says the

jobs that he used to do there's already

people that are doing that just trying

to find what his role is and says he'll

blend in even better next year

obviously Luis Enrique showing faith

first off the bench today hey

some of it don't short

[Applause]

- no fetes little peek over at his

barcelona counterpart

[Applause]

[Applause]

[Music]

spinning to the inside

dance for alba they say loosening up on

the Real Madrid bench and now looks like

we might be seeing a change for the

matang gaze you should come off the boil

just a bit with his final quarter our

deflected but almost too messy Aldridge

for bail reaches back well Clint sends

it in men's Emma tries to duplicate

wonderful from the postman hurdling the

challenge boss gets it back

maybe with a handball and it looks like

here will come the switch and Benzema

the player coming out a different look

they see different animal the content

here to place been fitting wonderful

goal scorer for Real Madrid he brought

them back into this game gets the caned

I trace from the world-class superstar

that he was Gesu nothing wrong with his

performance tonight

he had tactically smart as well he has

his wonderful flash of pure inspiration

your chance for anybody once it got over

and took that deflection but he

catapulted that one horn when he first

goal of the season in league play for

Benzema now this will likely push

Ronaldo higher up more into that cr9

role you know give more pertinently fill

our saloon has bat Lane a whole

different dynamic to deal with because

this man s he has got speed to burn and

if he gets half of a chance I can't

you've seen the very very good at

finishing off half chances

all right looks like si actually in the

middle is your skits earns the whistle

real question now is for Real Madrid how

much do they want to push for a second

goal as Barcelona looks content to bleed

another game off the schedule as he

stripped conseguido again si out whines

Rinaldo can he find the angle

[Music]

[Applause]

Kristiana doing the right thing train

his little daggerboard a faint Oh Hesse

who would run on the other side of him

once and then change his direction

beautifully good ball jams force water

side of the book but he can't throw it

home let's close up with this one and he

did when he had you up and never again

coming Convention on the hold up

chanting his arms it's got a wicked

angle to faint and a great distance but

he nearly rattles the same netting of

Kela novice good run again

wait up the middle ghost lays it off ese

keeps it moving

here's Marcelo Oh Rinaldo on his flank

fail screaming forward looking for the

Welshman

[Music]

[Applause]

ten minutes left let's match the lead

well this is it go let us beat this

alone

this would be better

is it a push

[Applause]

this is what it looks like the referees

assistant is Singh

life chain and look like a perfectly

good Gore and beautifully etch in yet

Marcelo started Cristiano feeds I don't

see anything wrong there people I'm

sorry on that angle there's nothing

wrong

that's a legitimately grid goal by

Gareth from this angle and again that's

a very harsh call against the mayor

breathing dragon that rises nicely and I

tell you what I think Johnny out by

recognizes then he's got a big fair

being dragon on his back in he was gonna

go down at the wrists limber contact the

certainly contact me and by Gareth field

but it's not enough to send him down

another colors real good field play on

says the referee chance now for Hess a

Marcelo worldwide and this bounced back

from the splat go slammer Ronaldo

[Music]

[Applause]

it's the top of the crossbar

[Applause]

Real Madrid that I'm picking apart

Barcelona here now a wonderful effort in

the release here as a smooth is the back

of the spoon from Cristiano who gets all

his ankles release

[Applause]

it is so close city

more than anybody down sidelines for

another check run to my AT&T and Kevin

Egan things getting interesting here for

bail a chance not ing fishing but

cleared by Alba Kevin they are indeed

Phil Shane and you got to keep an eye on

zinedine zidane he has come to life in

the second half here on the bench for

Real Madrid when the goal went in he

celebrated with his technical staff with

the substitute with everybody and he

seemed to be the last person inside camp

now that realized that the goal was

disallowed it was phenomenal viewing see

Dan clearly furious afterwards Phil

thank you very much ter daughter sobrino

a FIFA assistant referee another racist

hellacious attempt at defending from

Alba and gareth again so close to not

making lo do bravo and getting the

go-ahead goal yet again there will be

plenty to argue about back in the

nation's capital Oh

Ramos going in strong he

one yellow and now his day is the

[Applause]

I think he shouldn't be not earlier but

again it's Suarez recognizing his

proximity in a lovely turn away from him

and they're arguing this referee but in

life Cain had certainly looked as if

this was a deserving second yellow

take a look again the spin is there in

the standing leg is teak and recklessly

and that is a tackle that would dehorn a

caribou

[Applause]

your question diving in they bombed Bob

Beamon at the Mexico Olympics and he's

in the showers

Jordi Cruyff and the barsa president

exchanging memories in the making how

much will this change things chipped up

met by Suarez but it can't come around

it placement if the passes down to the

pixel from you-know-who we kind of

adjusted quickly enough to get a sweet

spot but the service to him today has

been you kind of get any better six

minutes remain in regulation Rey and win

lose or draw we will learn a lot over

those six minutes about what zinedine

zidane has done with Real Madrid in his

brief time seconds earlier they're

celebrating a game winner only to see it

snatched away and now they're down a man

looking to hold on they're still coming

on kind of a howl with Jose for bail

it's on his right hangs it up for

Ronaldo on my channels shoots

this the other again

he theorized 'as the defenders a

beautiful setup from Gareth Bale family

the Devane connection occurs

right here bliss Theodore has drama

storm's buzzing about it is funny that

belong in a Bengal tiger once he gets

the service a wonderful run by kava how

has he plays it out the wonderful

rainbow pass cristianos got a lot of

decisions to make he does it brilliantly

superlative again and Christian or more

Sparky than a downed power line here no

angle he goes through the way wickets

through the legs of Claudio Bravo

but what certainly looks like the match

winner now but tame on the clock still

go Cristiano Ronaldo making that climb

up the Pichichi chart as not quite the

smiles in the Barcelona side of the

president's box is 29th

what a life lane for Real Madrid still

plenty of time on the clock

as far as Barcelona's concern but Messi

pickpocketed but Phil on the longer look

that was such a combination between the

two players who have been always

categorizes not perhaps getting along

with each other only got along each

other lake heckle and Jeckle their

wonderful goal for the lead 7th minute

is Neymar bursting forward looking for

an equaliser top of the box lays it back

Messi the Flex kicked off by any

and cleared we still might have some

change but what a huge goal for Ronaldo

only the eight league clásico goal he is

scored but the 16th of all time only

disgusting chance for SWAT has been a

push and he gets decked by Pepe whistle

had already blown it makes no difference

whether it has blown a box if this is an

intentional challenge by Pepe which I'm

not sure it is does he try to get out of

the web does he continue their

continuing take a look at this our

Hennessey man-of-the-match and a chance

for Ronaldo to be the hero never stop

never settle the man of the match

brought to you by Hennessey

again the twists and turns are beautiful

the pass now it's a string of pearls and

you escopeta where is jewelry Cristiano

then the service is tremendous he's got

so much to do and he is as cool as a

bomb-disposal expert once that ball

started coming to him the coolest head

in company just yester as smooth as some

Hennessy poked away from Modric top of

the box

Taron getting rid of it now it seems as

though Barcelona with a spark they've

got a man advantage but they're down a

goal and two minutes left of regulation

did they take it too easy the 39 match

unbeaten streak about to be snapped and

a smile on Ronaldo's face as he turns

around three out ready to bleed the

clock a bit more Lucas Vasquez getting

set to check in talk about feeding the

wind into the seals if as I said at the

start this Real Madrid team coming in on

those four wins and had been playing

good football their best football I said

at the time unless he done out here too

dear I think Barcelona are going to look

at a number of opportunities where they

should have patted the lead

unquestionably and they were denied

remember by killing out us in the most

astonishing ways but then Marcello

intervened bravely leaving his position

at the back the substitution worked a

treat and of course the big superstar

this man come out and

really made the exclamation point would

step in Marcelo trying to win it back

but a sizing tackle a lunging tackle

from Aldridge and Down Goes Iniesta and

Rey I have been among the first to

criticize Ronaldo and his performance

away from home and in big games but you

could send something turning since the

calendar turned and right now boy is he

blossoming at the right time bail will

be coming out and he's going to take his

time to do it giving us the chance Rey

barring a complete disaster against

Wolfsburg in the Champions League and

understanding even this will draw them

closer to Barcelona in La Liga that

title probably already decided what we

see here today is it enough for Real

Madrid to stick with zinedine zidane for

next year we don't know that I don't

know and nobody knows other than the

president but these are the performances

that will keep him in a job nor matter

what this is a grid response from

Beale Madrid after being down eagle

lookout dartle the box draped across two

minutes to be added in this added time

brought you by Corona Extra who invites

you to find your Beach 90 seconds of

that great piece extra classic Oh from

Hesse bursts of speed for Vasquez as

they try and just keep away Wow

one on one with attitude on gonna taking

now BK launching himself forward he

wants to be at the end of any

desperation crosses if need be

Nesta poked back for my ah no final

minute approaches care joining in the

attack now he's always the poor two guy

in last chance saloon for Barcelona

lifted by Iniesta cleared away by Pepe

this place gone awfully quiet just three

shots for Messi only one on target he

did pass into a number of dangerous

chances but Ronaldo has won that duel on

the day for 30 seconds to go oh look at

that man in black don't forget that man

in between the sticks for Real Madrid

deny him look out Neymar slips it

with the chance but it's casamento in

the way and that might do it

ronaldo against elvis the equalizer

maybe eight yards from finding the net

up front for Pepe bravo scrambles back

Vasquez can't get to it as Mascherano

snuffs out the chance

Massimino might not have even seen it -

Don set it right down Main Street and

that is going to do it it's a Ronaldo

goal has given Real Madrid victory at

the Capitol and the unbeaten streak is

over a branding like this just won La

Liga this is how much it means to them

this was a statement game I said coming

in Barcelona that's it more than enough

to win this game but they missed their

chances and Cristiano Ronaldo did not

smile little late up the Stars and

eclipse the Sun the man of the moment

Cristiano Ronaldo and he was the

difference-maker Suarez not chopped

until he got in front of goal Lima was

probably the best of the vaunted msn

there were wonderful performances and

poor sales but reality is heart and grit

and determination more than anything

parks was the tipping point in this game

Gerard piqué in responded in rallied

when a tremendous go ahead gore but he's

not smiling on the outside he is beaming

on the inside well it was a thriller at

the end the scoreless first half and

three huge goals in the second including

a Ronaldo winner at the wire the clásico

goes reals way on enemy ground and all

the reactions and fall out as we

continue el clásico on bein sports
